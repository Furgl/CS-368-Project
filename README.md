# CS-368-Project

Maybe we can use this file as a place to store our ideas.

Notes from Proposal: 
- Built with a GUI, maybe with SFML
- Similar design to other online Tower Defense games
  - Different levels/stages, each with a different level design and different waves of enemies
  - Player spends resources to select towers that are placed along the path and attack enemies that move down the path
  - Placed towers will probably have options to upgrade or sell when selected
  - Each tower will have a different cost, attack type (splash, poison, slowness, etc.), damage, range, and attack speed
  - Player will have a limited number of lives that are decreased when enemies make it to the end of the path - game over when 0 lives left
  - Probably design to allow multiple entrances, exits, and paths for the enemies to take for added challenge
- Sound effects/music taken from royalty-free sound websites
- Save and load game to/from disk
- Pause option in game that stops enemies from moving and towers from attacking
- Main menu when the game is first loaded 
- Textures and sprites will mostly be made by us (simple, maybe futuristic, theme)
- Scores given to player for defeating enemies (hiscores if we have time)
