# CS-368-Project

Jake Pollard & Jason Waner

The code was built within Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and can run on Windows operating systems for sure withing Microsoft VS but should be able to run on other systems as well upon building the solution.
Once the solution is built it is able to be run normally with the Title Screen being clearly displayed within a new window.
This program does rely on SFML 2.4.2 however we included the SFML folder within our project and made the path to that folder so there is no need to have to download SFML in order to run it.
