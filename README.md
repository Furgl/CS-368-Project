# CS-368-Project

Jake Pollard & Jason Waner

This code was built within Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 on Windows operating systems. The project should be able to be opened by downloading the files in this repository and clicking on CS 368.sln with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 installed. 

If you have any troubles compiling the solution in Visual Studio, you should be able to run just the compiled project by running Project.exe in the Win32Project1 folder. If you still cannot run the code properly, let us know and we will help figure it out.

Once the solution is built, it is able to be run normally with the Title Screen being clearly displayed within a new window.

This program does rely on SFML 2.4.2, however we included the SFML folder within our project and made the path to that folder, so there should be no need to have to download SFML in order to run it.
